## Submitting issues

### Test case required

**All bug reports and problem issues require a jsFiddle**.   
[Please fork this Pen as a baseline](https://codepen.io/fitodac/pen/GzVPEw).

+ A test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
+ It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug.
+ Assets are not minified (we cannot debug .min.js files).
+ A link to your production site is **not** a reduced test case.

Providing a test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a test case; your issue may be closed.  
You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue with the provided fiddle.

## Support

Although **bsnav** is designed to be super easy to use, there's always things that can go wrong, especially when interacting with other plugins and complicated websites. If you are **having problems getting bsnav to work**, or can't figure something out, please, open a new issue.
